        <h1>About the Philippines</h1>
            <p>Philippines, also known as the Republic of Philippines, is the largest archipelago in the world, comprising 7641
            islands! The country is famous for its abundant picturesque and sun-kissed beaches. A lesser known fact is that
            it is
            home to a wide variety of exotic fruits viz mangosteen, papaya, and banana.
            <br>
            Here In the Philippines, there are about 76 to 78 major language groups, with more than 500 dialects. That was
            because
            our country was conquered by the Spanish and later on the American.
            <br>
            We are known as most hospitable, and we are appreciated by many people for doing good things to others even
            though they
            do not know each other or just strangers.
            Another great thing to know about filipino culture is that every filipino <em>loves</em> to celebrate any
            occasion. May it be
            simple like graduation, birthday, Job promotion, and more. Many filipino here in the Philippine culture and
            tradition
            have been known worldwide and is one of the main reasons foreigners love spending the holidays in the country.
            That's
            why there are a lot of foreigners who love to come back here and to join us to celebrate some of the biggest
            events here
            in the Philippines.</p>

        <h2> FIESTAS EVERYWHERE!</h2>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
            <p>
                Did you know the culturally rich Philippines has over 100 Fiestas (Festivals) annually? Each city or province has a
                local fiesta. Being a very religious centered country, a fiesta is usually about the celebration of that city or
                province patron saint. While “fiesta season” spans throughout the year, it is safe to say that there is at least one major festival happening throughout the country at any given week. With majority of those festivals originating from pre-colonial traditions in local cities and communities or rooted in Christianity from the Spanish Colonial Era.
