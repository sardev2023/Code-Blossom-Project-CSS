    <h1>Philippines: Love that Mixes Culture and Pride</h1>
     <p>The Philippines is full of natural beauty, including gorgeous
    beaches, hills that look like candy drops, amazing waterfalls,
    old rice terraces, and reefs full of marine life. However, visitors
    are not likely to see such wonders unaccompanied, as the locals
    are very outgoing. They consider solitude-seekers an oddity â€”
    Filipinos prefer to have company.Filipinos <em>love</em> celebration and each city and barrio has at least one local festival of its own,called FIESTA - usually on the feast of its patron saint, so that there is always a fiesta going on somewhere in the country.
