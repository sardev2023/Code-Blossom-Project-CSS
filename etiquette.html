                <h2>The Power of Respectful Language</h2>
            
                <p>Adding “po” and “opo” to “yes” and “no” shows deference, being especially important when interacting with elders. Even
                “Kuya” (for older males) and “Ate” (for older females) used towards service staff shows good manners. Learn a few key
                phrases — it makes a huge difference in demonstrating respect, a core principle of Filipino travel etiquette!</p>

                <h2>Modest is Best</h2>
                    <p>Especially outside major cities, dress on the conservative side. This avoids unwanted attention and shows respect,
                    particularly when visiting religious sites or smaller villages.</p>

                <h2>Leave Your Shoes at the Door </h2>
                        <p>Homes and many businesses are shoes-off zones. Observe and follow suit, showing respect for the space. Always keep your
                        socks in good repair and  holes are a no-no</p>
                    <!-- Image here for emphasis -->

        <li>
                <h2>Support Local Businesses</h2> 
                        <p>Buy meals and souvenirs from small shops whenever possible. It directly benefits communities and lets you discover unique finds. Learning to haggle politely with a smile makes it worthwhile.</p>

        <li>
                <h2>Respect religious traditions</h2>
                        <p>Filipinos are very spiritual people, being in a largely Catholic country. Statues of saints, holy festivals, and religious traditions are sacred and significant to the Philippine culture. Filipinos may find something funny out of
                            every situation, but they take their religion seriously.</p>

        <li>
                <h2>Food = Community</h2>
                        <p>Filipino hospitality often revolves around food. If offered a meal or snack, accept even a small portion to show
                        appreciation. Learn to eat with a spoon and fork (sometimes even with your hands!) to enjoy dishes like a local.</p>
